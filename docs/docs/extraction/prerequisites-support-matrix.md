# Pre-Requisites & Support Matrix

Before you begin using [NeMo Retriever Library](overview.md), confirm your software stack, deployment hardware, and—if you use them—advanced features (audio and video, Nemotron Parse, VLM image captioning, reranking) against the guidance in this page.

## Software Requirements { #software-requirements }

- Linux operating systems (Ubuntu 22.04 or later recommended)
- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (NVIDIA Driver >= `580`, CUDA >= `13.0`)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `3.12` — required to install and run the NeMo Retriever Library Python API, CLI, and related packages from PyPI (for example `pip` or `uv`). Older Python versions will fail dependency resolution without a clear error.
- [UV Python package and environment manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (optional; recommended for creating isolated environments)
- For audio and video, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` must be on `PATH` (for example
  `sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu).
  `ffmpeg-python` and `nemo-retriever[multimedia]` do not install these binaries.
  For container and Kubernetes guidance, refer to [Audio and video](audio-video.md).
- For PDF extraction with `extract_method="nemotron_parse"`, install the Nemotron Parse
  client dependencies with `pip install "nemo-retriever[nemotron-parse]"` (pulls
  `open-clip-torch`, which provides the `open_clip` module required by the Nemotron Parse
  NIM client). The base `nemo-retriever` install and `[local]` extra do not include this
  package.

!!! note

    When you use UV, create the environment with Python 3.12 — for example, `uv venv --python 3.12`. This matches the `requires-python` metadata in the library packages.

## Hardware Requirements { #hardware-requirements }

The full ingestion pipeline is designed to consume significant CPU and memory resources to achieve maximal parallelism. 
Resource usage scales up to the limits of your deployed system.

For per-feature GPU memory, disk, and co-residency rules, refer to [Model hardware requirements](#model-hardware-requirements) below.


### Recommended Production Deployment Specifications

- **System Memory**: At least 256 GB RAM
- **CPU Cores**: At least 32 CPU cores
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with at least 24 GB VRAM (for example, A100, H100, L40S, or equivalent)

!!! note

    Using less powerful systems or lower resource limits is still viable, but performance will suffer.

### Resource Consumption Notes

- The pipeline performs runtime allocation of parallel resources based on system configuration
- Memory usage can reach up to the full system capacity for large document processing
- CPU utilization scales with the number of concurrent processing tasks
- GPU is required for inference using HuggingFace models or NIMs
- GPU is NOT required for build.nvidia.com hosted inference

### Scaling Considerations

For production deployments processing large volumes of documents, consider:
- Higher memory configurations for processing large PDF files or image collections
- Additional CPU cores for improved parallel processing
- Multiple GPUs for distributed processing workloads

### Environment Requirements

Ensure your deployment environment meets these specifications before running the full pipeline. Resource-constrained environments may experience performance degradation.

## Core and Advanced Pipeline Features { #core-and-advanced-pipeline-features }

The NeMo Retriever Library extraction core pipeline features run on a single A10G or better GPU.

Optional advanced features—audio and video transcription, Nemotron Parse, Omni image captioning, and the VL reranker—are **not** part of that core footprint. Audio, video, Nemotron Parse, and Omni captioning each need **one or more additional dedicated GPUs** beyond the GPU running the four core NIMs; the VL reranker can share the core GPU when it has at least 80 GB VRAM. Capacity requirements are listed in the **Additional Dedicated GPUs** rows of the [model hardware requirements](#model-hardware-requirements) table below.

### Default Helm NIMs { #default-helm-nims }

The production Helm chart enables these NIM microservices **by default** (for example through `nimOperator.*.enabled=true`):

| Helm flag | NIM | Role |
|-----------|-----|------|
| `page_elements` | [nemotron-page-elements-v3](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-page-elements-v3) | Page layout and element detection |
| `table_structure` | [nemotron-table-structure-v1](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-table-structure-v1) | Table structure extraction |
| `ocr` | [nemotron-ocr-v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2) | Image OCR |
| `vlm_embed` | [llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2) | Multimodal (VL) embedding |

### OCR artifacts (Helm vs local Hugging Face) { #nemotron-ocr-v2-language-mode }

!!! note

    **Helm / NIM:** The production chart deploys **Nemotron OCR v2** under `nimOperator.ocr` (`nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2:1.4.0`). For image defaults and upgrade notes, refer to [OCR NIM configuration](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/main/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md#ocr-nim-configuration) in the Helm chart README.

    **Local Hugging Face inference:** When you deploy locally with HuggingFace model weights (for example `pip install "nemo-retriever[local]"` and GPU inference without remote OCR NIM URLs), the default OCR engine is **Nemotron OCR v2**, which runs in **multilingual** mode by default. For CLI flags and API parameters, refer to [Nemotron OCR v2 — language mode](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/main/nemo_retriever/docs/cli/README.md#nemotron-ocr-v2-language-mode). Remote OCR NIM endpoints use their own model and language behavior; local OCR language selectors are not sent on remote requests.

Default OCR NIM container for release Helm deployments:

- **Image:** `nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2:1.4.0`

Default VL embedder container and model for release deployments:

- **Image:** `nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2:1.12.0`
- **Model ID:** `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2`

### Optional Helm NIMs (not auto-wired) { #optional-helm-nims-not-auto-wired-by-default }

These NIM microservices are **optional** for the default extraction pipeline. The retriever service does **not** call them until you enable the matching pipeline stage (reranker, Nemotron Parse, caption, or audio). In production, disable keys you do not need (refer to [Recommended minimal install](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/main/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md#recommended-minimal-install-2605)). Set `nimOperator.<key>.enabled=true` when you want that NIM reconciled. Chart keys are in the [NeMo Retriever Helm chart README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/main/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md#nim-operator-sub-stack).

| Helm flag | NIM | Role |
|-----------|-----|------|
| `rerankqa` | [llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2) | Reranking for improved retrieval accuracy |
| `nemotron_parse` | [nemotron-parse](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Parse-v1.2) | Optional PDF `extract_method="nemotron_parse"` (default PDF extraction uses **pdfium**) |
| `nemotron_3_nano_omni_30b_a3b_reasoning` | [nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni-30B-A3B-Reasoning-BF16) | Supported image captioning when you enable the caption stage |
| `audio` | [parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1.1b) | [Audio and video](audio-video.md) transcription |

### Image captioning { #image-captioning }

Use **`nemotron_3_nano_omni_30b_a3b_reasoning`** when you enable the caption stage (hosted model ID `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning`). The Helm key is in the [optional NIMs](#optional-helm-nims-not-auto-wired-by-default) table above.

Optional features in the table above require GPU capacity **beyond the four default NIMs**. Audio and video transcription, Nemotron Parse, and Omni image captioning each need a **dedicated additional GPU** (or two, for Omni on L40S) separate from the core pipeline GPU. The VL reranker can share the core GPU only when that GPU has at least 80 GB of VRAM. Otherwise, treat the reranker as a standalone workload. Each optional feature also needs extra disk space and feature-specific system dependencies.

For published NIM model IDs and deployment-specific constraints, use the product support matrices linked under [Related Topics](#related-topics) below.

## Model Hardware Requirements { #model-hardware-requirements }

NeMo Retriever Library supports the following GPU hardware given system constraints in the table.

**Additional Dedicated GPUs** counts GPUs required **in addition to** the one GPU reserved for the [core pipeline](#core-and-advanced-pipeline-features) (the four default NIMs). For example, a deployment that runs the core pipeline on one H100 and self-hosted Parakeet ASR needs **two GPUs total**: one for the core pipeline and one additional.

- **HF model weights** — approximate Hugging Face checkpoint footprint (files such as `model*.safetensors`, `weights.pth`, or other published weight bundles in the model repository). Values are rounded from the current public file listing and can change when the repository is updated.
- **NIM disk space** — approximate container and on-disk model cache for self-hosted NIM microservices (not the same as HF download size). For Nemotron 3 Nano Omni captioning, refer to the [NVIDIA NIM for Vision Language Models support matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/vision-language-models/latest/support-matrix.html#nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning).

Model repositories and NIM references are linked in [Core and Advanced Pipeline Features](#core-and-advanced-pipeline-features) above.

**B200, H200 NVL, and audio/video extraction:** The [audio and video](audio-video.md) transcription path (self-hosted Parakeet ASR through `nimOperator.audio`) is **not supported on B200**, other Blackwell GPUs, or **H200 NVL**. Core PDF and multimodal extraction on those GPUs is unchanged. Refer to footnote ⁴ below.

¹ On other supported GPUs, Parakeet ASR (`parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us:1.5.0`) may require a runtime TensorRT engine build (no prebuilt profile in the chart image).

⁴ Self-hosted [audio/video extraction](audio-video.md) through Parakeet ASR (`parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us:1.5.0`, `nimOperator.audio`) is **not supported** on **B200**, other **Blackwell** GPUs (compute capability 12.0), including RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell and RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell, or **H200 NVL**. Core PDF and multimodal extraction on those GPUs is unchanged. Video workflows that depend on Parakeet for speech transcription are affected the same way. `NIMService` for `nimOperator.audio` may stay not Ready or enter `CrashLoopBackOff` while building the Riva/TensorRT engine (for example ONNX Runtime IR version, cuDNN visibility, or FP8 tactic errors). Use a supported dedicated GPU (for example H100 or A100), [hosted Parakeet on build.nvidia.com](audio-video.md#parakeet-hosted-inference-build-nvidia), or set `nimOperator.audio.enabled=false`.

³ Opt-in Omni captioning uses the [nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning](https://docs.api.nvidia.com/nim/reference/nvidia-nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning) NIM (`nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning:1.7.0-variant`). BF16 requires at least 80 GB total GPU memory; refer to the [VLM NIM support matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/vision-language-models/latest/support-matrix.html#nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning). L40S requires two GPUs. A100 40GB, A10G, and RTX PRO 4500 are below the minimum.

\* GPUs with less than 80GB VRAM cannot run the reranker concurrently with the core pipeline. 
To perform recall testing with the reranker on these GPUs, shut down the core pipeline NIM microservices 
and run only the embedder, reranker, and your vector database.
